    "Anscombe's quartett consists of four datasets with almost identical descriptive statistics, but when each dataset is displayed graphically they are displayed very differently [1]. Each dataset includes eleven x,y coordinates [1].\n",
    "The statistician Francis Anscombe created the dataset in 1973 to show the following two points:\n",
    "1. The importance to use graphs before analysing the data\n",
    "2. Statisical propertties can be effected by outliers [1].\n",
    "The dataset counters the common impression among statisticians that:\"\n",
    "1. numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough;\n",
    "2. for any particular kind of statistical data there is just one set of calculations consituting a correct statistical analysis;\n",
    "3. performing intricate calculations is virtuous, whereas actually looking at the data is cheating.\" [2, p. 17].\n",
    "How the datasets were created is not known but"
